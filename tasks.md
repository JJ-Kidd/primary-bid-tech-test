The specs for the application are:
- [ ] A user needs to be able to enter a URL and they will get an 8 character (lowercase-alphanumeric) shortened version of the URL.
- [x] URLs are shortened and persisted into MongoDB via a REST or GraphQL API.
- [ ] The frontend app will display a list of previously shortened URLs.
- [ ] New URLs will be generated and added to the frontend list.
- [x] The same 8-characters cannot be used twice i.e. each shortened URL needs to be unique.
- [x] The URLs need to be shortened with the following domain 'pbid.io' e.g. https://pbid.io/f3x2ab1c
- [ ] The shortened URL do not need to actually redirect/work as the domain doesnâ€™t exist.
- [x] The entire system needs to be runnable using Docker, a simple compose file will do.
- [x] Appropriate tests should be added to the code, using the jest framework.
- [ ] The app layout should be responsive.
